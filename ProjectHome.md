The purpose of QFFTExplorer is to learn the FFT function, and learn how to implement it in C++.

Originally written by Paul Lupus, in Qt/C++, now he is porting this software to Java.

I try to maintain his QT/C++ based code, and hopefully can catchup its feature with his current version.

it is tested on Qt 4.8.0 on window 32 bit.

Please contribute and use this software.

TODO:
- modify dataprocessor class to work in window, spectrum example in Qt is the candidate.

- shall we change plotting to QWT ?

- add more signal type : mixed sinusoid, square, saw, non-periodic.

any problem pls contact rusman (dot) rusyadi
